-----------
* Corn and black bean salad
* Garlic/lime/cilantro rice

Notes
-----------
* This is fairly spicy. If you're sensative to spiciness, reduce the amount of jalapenos you put in (maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of the container)
* The tofu was unneccesary. It might have been good to sub in some black beans or other vegetables.
