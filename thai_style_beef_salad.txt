Thai Style Beef Salad
=====================

+ 1/4 cup vinegar
+ 1/4 water
+ 1 teaspoon sugar
+ 1/2 small red onion , sliced thin
+ 1.25 lbs flank steak , trimmed of excess fat
+ Salt and ground black pepper
+ 1/4 cup fish sauce
+ 1/4 cup juice from 3 limes
+ 4 tsp brown sugar
+ 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
+ 1/2 medium cucumber, peeled, seeded, and sliced thin
+ 4 tblsp packed fresh cilantro leaves , torn
+ 1 5oz bag of prewashed baby salad greens
+ 1/4 cup unsalted dry-roasted peanuts , chopped coarse

Directions
----------
1. Combine vinegar, water, sugar, and onions in a medium bowl. Let sit for 30 minutes.

1. Turn-on grill on high, and let preheat for 10 minuets. Pat the steak dry with paper towels, then season generously with salt and pepper. Grill the steak until well browned on both sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer the steak to a plate, cover with foil and let rest for 10 minutes.

1. Meanwhile, whisk the fish sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, and pepper flakes together in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved. Pour half of the dressing into a large bowl and set aside.

1. Slice the steak crosswise on the bias into -inch-thick slices. Cut the longer slices in half, into roughly 3-inch lengths. Add the steak to the small bowl of dressing, toss to coat, and let marinate for 5 minutes.

1. Remove the steak from the dressing and discard the marinade. Toss the steak, cucumber, onion, and cilantro mint with the reserved dressing in the large bowl. Arrange the lettuce on individual plates. Spoon the steak and vegetables over the lettuce. Drizzle the salad with any dressing left in the bowl and sprinkle with the peanuts before serving.

+ Adapted From: [Cooks Illustrated](http://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/detail.asp?docid=21931)
+ We subbed in Tri-tip cuts instead of flank steak, because we couldn't find a piece of flank steak less than 2.5 lbs at the grocery store.
+ In general, for recipes that call for a small amount of mint, we typically just omit it. This is especially true for recipes that call for cilantro
+ A couple of months ago, we just started making pickled red onions, and leaving them in the 'fridge. We fully recommend this, and will publish a recipe for it at some point. The basics are this: slice a red onion up, and stuff the slices into a mason jar along with a teaspoon of black peppercorns and a 1/2 teaspoon of sugar. In the remaining space of the jar, pour in a 1:1 mixture of white vinegar and water. Then they can live in your fridge for a couple of weeks (or longer?), and use them whenever you want. If you have these in your fridge, you can skip the first 4 ingredients and the first step.
